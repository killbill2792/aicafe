# Progress

State file so any agent (Claude Code, Codex, Kimi) can pick up where the last one stopped.
Read `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) first, then this file, then only the `docs/` files the next task needs.

## Milestones

- [x] **M0. Skeleton** — Next.js + TS + Tailwind + Supabase + next-intl (en/es/ar, RTL) + PWA manifest, design tokens, fonts, bottom tab bar (5 tabs, empty screens), CLAUDE.md commands work.
- [ ] **M1. Database + demo seed** — Supabase migrations for `04-data-model.md`, RLS on, Fixture A demo café seed, magic-link login.
- [ ] **M2. Calculations** — `lib/calc/` implementing every formula in `05-calculations.md`; Fixture A/B pass as Vitest tests.
- [ ] **M3. Core screens on demo data** — Home, Money (cost recovery + profit & costs), Menu, Break-even, built from mockups.
- [ ] **M4. Cost capture** — Monthly bills, manual/voice entry, bank statement upload (CSV/PDF), receipt photos, vendor rule learning, dedupe.
- [ ] **M5. Square connection** — OAuth (sandbox first), backfill, webhooks + poll, rollups, onboarding wizard.
- [ ] **M6. CSV import for Toast/other POS** — Column mapper, saved mappings.
- [ ] **M7. Alerts + milestones** — Missing bill, voids, meal break, early clock-in, overstaffed slot, covered milestone cards.
- [ ] **M8. Pilot hardening** — Error states, loading skeletons, reconnect flow, delete account, privacy page, screen-view analytics, Sentry.

v1.5 (after pilot starts): Staff screen live, "Why today was different", weekly text, native-speaker translation review.

## New dependencies (one-line reason each)

- `next` 16.3.6, `react`/`react-dom` 19.2.8 — current stable; note Next 16 renamed the `middleware.ts` convention to `proxy.ts` (used here) and made Turbopack the default for dev/build.
- `next-intl` ^4.14.7 — required for en/es/ar routing + RTL per CLAUDE.md.
- `tailwindcss` ^3.4.19 (classic `tailwind.config.ts`), not v4 — CLAUDE.md says tokens live "in tailwind.config"; v4's CSS-first `@theme` model fights that convention, so v3 was pinned for a config file every future agent can read directly. Revisit if the team wants v4 later.
- `lucide-react` ^1.48.0 — nav icons; design doc explicitly allows it to "fill gaps" alongside custom SVGs.
- `@supabase/supabase-js` ^2.117.2 — Supabase client per stack. Only anon-key browser/server factories exist so far; cookie-based session handling (`@supabase/ssr`) for magic-link/OTP auth is M1 work.
- `zod`, `date-fns`, `date-fns-tz` — installed per CLAUDE.md stack section, not yet used (no forms/dates in M0's empty screens).
- `typescript` ^5 (not the new ^7 major) — matches `create-next-app`'s own pin; `eslint-config-next`/`typescript-eslint` compatibility with TS7 isn't proven yet.
- `@types/node` bumped to ^22 (from `create-next-app`'s default ^20) — Vitest 5 requires `@types/node` ^22 or >=24 as a peer.
- `vitest` ^5.0.2 — CLAUDE.md requires Vitest for `lib/calc/`; no `jsdom`/Testing Library yet since M0 has no component tests.

## Session log

_(newest first)_

### 2026-09-26 — M0 Skeleton (done)
Scaffolded with `create-next-app` (Next 16.3.6, Turbopack, TS strict) into a temp dir, then hand-merged into this repo so the existing `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`README.md`/`docs/`/`design/` were untouched. Built:
- `app/[locale]/` routing via next-intl (`i18n/routing.ts`, `request.ts`, `navigation.ts`, root `proxy.ts`) for en/es/ar; `getDirection()` flips `dir="rtl"` for Arabic. Verified in-browser: `/ar` renders `lang="ar" dir="rtl"`, tab bar mirrors, IBM Plex Sans Arabic loads.
- Tailwind v3 config (`tailwind.config.ts`) with every color/font/radius token from `docs/02-design-system.md`; Fraunces/Figtree/IBM Plex Sans Arabic via `next/font/google`.
- Bottom tab bar (`components/TabBar.tsx`): Home/Money/Menu/Staff/More, icon+label, 48px targets, active-tab highlight, `aria-current`.
- PWA: `public/manifest.json` + `public/sw.js` (minimal network-falling-back-to-cache) + `components/ServiceWorkerRegister.tsx`. Manifest verified loading in-browser; **SW registration could not be verified** — it fails with "unknown error fetching the script" specifically inside this session's sandboxed preview browser (the `/sw.js` file itself serves fine via plain `fetch`, 200/correct content-type). Registration is wrapped in try/catch so this fails silently rather than breaking the app; re-verify in a real Chrome/Safari tab before relying on installability.
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` + `server.ts`: anon-key client factories, env-var driven. No DB/auth wiring yet (M1).
- Empty screens for all 5 tabs, all using `next-intl` messages (no hardcoded strings).
- `npm run dev/build/lint/test/db:reset` all exist and work; `db:reset` is a placeholder that logs until M1 adds migrations.

Verified: `npm run build` (all 15 pages — 3 locales × 5 routes — prerender), `npm run test` (2 passing smoke tests on `lib/utils/cn.ts`), `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run dev` + manual browser check at mobile width (375px) for en and ar, and a real **Lighthouse accessibility audit against the Home screen scored 100/100** (target was ≥95).

Next: M1 (Supabase migrations from `docs/04-data-model.md`, RLS, Fixture A seed, magic-link login).
